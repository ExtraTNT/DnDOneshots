		\subsection{General informations}
			This oneshot is designed for 4 level 10 characters. If you want to play with less or more people and/or character on a different level, you should adjust the encounters.\linebreak
			The oneshot is designed for DnD 5e and will not work with earlier versions of the game.\linebreak
			There are no descriptions on how something locks in detail, you as the dm should explain it to the players as you imagine it.\linebreak
			Furthermore, the oneshot is designed to be fun and not to deliver particularly good encounters or extremely difficult puzzles.\linebreak
			And finally, if you want, you can customize the oneshot according to your own preferences. It can also be used to start a campaign.
		\subsection{Recommended optional rules}

	\section{Story}
		In a nearby kingdom, the king was murdered by troops from haSyol. The son of the head wolf of a Lythari pack was there. When he took revenge on the king of haSyol, he realized that the troops from haSyol did not act without reason. If a war will break out, the pack could be in danger and if haSyol will lose, it will be a problem in anyway, because haSyol looks for small villages and settlements, the others only want to subjugate.\linebreak
		When the news came to the head wolf, he decided to get ancient magical weapons from a temple. These weapons were left there by them hundreds of years ago. They served in a previous war, when they helped the druids against a group of necromancers. The temple is well protected by traps and puzzles, so a team of the four best adventurers has been put together to retrieve the weapons. Now the four of you are gathered in front of the temple.\linebreak
		What do you want to do next?
	\section{Quest}
		Bring back the magic weapons from the temple.\linebreak
		The oneshot is over, if they leave the temple with the weapons

	\section{Traps}
		\DndItemHeader{Improved Bear Trap}{Simple Trap}
		A bear trap resembles a set of iron jaws that springs shut when stepped on, clamping down on a creature's leg. The trap is spiked in the ground, leving the victims immobilized.\\
		\textbf{Trigger.} A creature that steps on the bear trap triggers it.\\
		\textbf{Effect.} The trap makes an attack against the triggering creature. The attack has a +10 attack bonus and deals \DndDice{2d10} piercing damage on a hit. The attack can't gain advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap has its speed reduced to 0. It can't move until it breaks free of the trap, which requires a successfull DC 18 Strenght check by the creature or another adjacent to the trap.\\
		\textbf{Countermeasures.} A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trap. A Successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thievens'tools disables it. A Character can step over the trap with a successful DC 16 Dexterity check.

	\section{Puzzles}
		\subsection{Temple Door Puzzle}
			Temple\linebreak
			To open the door of the temple, you need to activate four crystals located under the roofs of the four towers around the temple. Activation is possible with either a spell or cantrip that produces light or radiant damage, or if no character can handle spells, with a torch. On the door of the temple there are four gems, with the letters N, E, S and W in it, those gems glow, when the crystal in the corresponding tower is activated. 
		\subsection{Golem Encounter}
			Tower 1\linebreak
			After killing the golem, the door opens.
		\subsection{Gem Puzzle}
			Tower 2\linebreak
			The puzzle consists of an oak table on which a gemstone is placed, there is also a carpet under the oak table. On the table is a writing: \say{A cross formed without breaking from the one gem, shall open the door. Infinite power it stands under the oak.} The solution here is to bring out four mirrors from under the carpet (Infinite power under the oak). If you place two mirrors opposite each other with the gemstone in the middle, it reflects infinitely.If you repeat the process with a second pair of mirrors, you can use the reflection to form a cross if you look at it at the right angle. That fulfills the condition. This puzzel is here quite clearly like a curse prescribed.
		\subsection{Pool Puzzle}
			Tower 3\linebreak
			The puzzle consists of a pool with four giant octopuses. Above them are ropes, from which you can swing back and forth (DC 15 Athletics or Acrobatics). At the end is a improved bear trap. While you are swinging back and forth, you get attacked by the octopuses (opportunity attack $\rightarrow$ grappled on a hit). The goal is to get the key on the table to open the next door. In itself there is no real solution to this puzzle, just get the key.
		\subsection{Wolf}
			Tower 3\linebreak
			To avoid the encounter with the wolf, a lythari must be in wolf form or one of the characters must have a wolf familiar with them. This must happen before the fight.
		\subsection{Mirror Puzzle}
			Tower 4\linebreak
			The door that prevents you from going further is a mirror. In the reflection in this mirror you can see a clay pitcher, which is not visible on your side. The solution is to either find the clay pitcher and place it so that it matches the reflection, or to create an illusion that matches it. After that the mirror shatters into pieces. The mirror cannot be broken in any other way or magically bypassed.
	\vfill
	\pagebreak
	\section{Encounter}
		\subsection{Animated Armor I}
			Temple\linebreak
			When the weapons are taken from the altar, the 10 armors, which are scattered across the temple, come to life and chase the characters. They can fight or just leave.
		\subsection{Golem}
			Tower 1\linebreak
			The golem starts attacking the players, as soon as they enter the room. There is only one golem and he is located a few feet in front of the middle wall facing to the entrance.
		\subsection{Animated Armor II}
			Tower 2\linebreak
			If a player is in a 20 ft radius of one of the armors, the whole site (3 armors) attacks. In total there are six armors split to two groups, standing on the wall in the room with the staircase.
		\subsection{Giant Octopus}
			Tower 3\linebreak
			The four giant octopuses attack, as soon as someone wants to cross the small pool where they are in. In total there are four giant octopuses.
		\subsection{Wolfs}
			Tower 3\linebreak
			The Wolfs start to attack the party, as soon as they can see them. Except a lythari is in wolf form or one of the characters has a wolf familiar with them. In total there are two wolfs and they are located in the corridor behind the door.
